# SnakeMania-Game


Snakemania is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake, which grows longer as it eats food while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. It was popularized by the Nokia mobile phone game "Snake" in the late 1990s and has since been implemented in many different forms.

A Snakemania game made in JavaScript involves using the programming language to create the game logic, graphics, and user interface. The game HTML divs to display the game board and the snake's movement. The game would also incorporate event listeners to detect keyboard input from the player, allowing them to control the snake's movement.
This game also has a background music which keeps on playing so that the game could be more engrossing.

In terms of game logic, the JavaScript code would need to handle collision detection between the snake and the walls or obstacles on the game board. It would also need to detect when the snake eats food and grow its body accordingly. Additionally, the code would need to handle the snake's movement and update the game board accordingly.
